## What this project does

The DGS (Digital Gamma-ray Spectrometer) detector system uses a small dedicated computer — a Motorola MVME5500 board running inside a VME crate — to read out data from gamma-ray detector electronics in real time. That computer runs **VxWorks 5.5** ✅ verified 2026-04-07 — `vxworks/Makefile:L2`, a real-time operating system designed for embedded hardware where timing and reliability matter more than user-friendliness.

To write software for the MVME5500, you cannot compile it on the board itself — the board has no development tools and is too slow for that. Instead, you compile on a modern Linux PC and produce a binary that runs on the PowerPC CPU inside the MVME5500. This is called **cross-compilation**: the machine you compile on (Ubuntu x86-64) is different from the machine that runs the result (PowerPC VxWorks).

This repository contains everything needed to reproduce that cross-compilation on Ubuntu 24, starting from source code and ending with `gretDet.munch` — the single binary file that gets loaded onto each MVME5500 crate to bring the detector IOC online. ✅ verified 2026-04-07 — `dgsDrivers/dgsDriverApp/src/README.md:L744` ("IOC boot: gretDet.munch loaded by VxWorks shell")

## Component Roles

### `x86-linux/` — Cross-compiler toolchain

This folder contains the compiler tools that run on your Ubuntu PC but produce code for the PowerPC CPU in the MVME5500. These are not the same as the system `gcc` on your PC — they speak a completely different instruction set.

Key tools:
- `ccppc` / `g++ppc` — C and C++ compilers targeting PowerPC VxWorks
- `ldppc` — linker that combines compiled pieces into a single binary
- `nmppc` — reads a binary and lists all its exported symbols (function/variable names)

These are pre-built binaries from Jefferson Lab; they are not compiled from source and are excluded from git (too large). Re-download from https://coda.jlab.org/drupal/content/ppc-cross-compilers. ✅ verified 2026-04-07 — `vxworks/README.md:L78,L194`

---

### `vxWorks/Tornado2.2/` — VxWorks header files

These are not compiled — they are **header files** (`.h`) that the compiler reads while compiling the driver code, so it knows the interface to VxWorks OS functions. Think of them as the VxWorks API reference that the compiler uses to check your code.

- `target/h/` — general VxWorks OS headers (`semLib.h`, `taskLib.h`, `vxWorks.h`, ...)
- `target/config/mv5500/` — MVME5500-specific headers, most importantly `universe.h` which describes the Universe II VME bridge chip registers

---

### `epics/base-3.14.12.1/` — EPICS base framework

EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System) is the control system framework used across most physics labs worldwide. It provides:

- A **build system** (based on GNU make with EPICS-specific rules) that all downstream components inherit. It knows how to cross-compile for VxWorks, how to run the munch step, etc.
- **Core runtime libraries** for the VxWorks target: channel access networking (`libca.a`), database processing (`libdbCore.a`), common utilities (`libCom.a`), and more.
- **Host tools** used during the build: `dbExpand` (merges database definition files), `makeBaseApp`, etc.

Building EPICS base is the first step — everything else depends on it.

---

### `synApps/asyn4-17/` — Hardware driver abstraction (asyn)

asyn is a standard EPICS add-on that provides a clean interface between EPICS database records and hardware drivers. Instead of each driver implementing its own threading, locking, and EPICS integration from scratch, drivers implement a standard "port driver" interface and asyn handles the rest.

The DGS digitizer and trigger drivers (`asynDigitizerDriver.cpp`, `asynTriggerDriver.cpp`) are all asyn port drivers.

Produces `libasyn.a` for the VxWorks target.

---

### `sncseq/sncseq-2.0.12/` — State machine compiler and runtime

The State Notation Compiler (snc/seq) lets you write control logic as **state machines** in a high-level language (`.st` files), then compiles them to C code that runs as tasks on VxWorks.

Two parts:
- `snc` — a **host tool** (runs on Ubuntu) that compiles `.st` → `.c`
- `libseq.a` / `libpv.a` — **VxWorks libraries** that execute those compiled state machines at runtime

The DGS driver uses three state machine files for its data flow control logic: `inLoop.st` (VME readout), `outLoop.st` (data validation), and `MiniSender.st` (network transmission).

---

### `dgsDrivers/` — DGS hardware driver library

This is the physics-lab-specific code: reading VME digitizer and trigger FIFOs via DMA, managing data buffers, controlling acquisition, sending data over the network. It uses all the frameworks above (EPICS, asyn, sncseq) and adds the hardware-specific logic on top.

Produces:
- `libdevDGSDriverSupport.a` — the compiled driver library for VxWorks
- `dgsDriver.dbd` — EPICS database definition file listing all the PV (Process Variable) record types this driver provides

This library is an **input** to `dgsIoc` — it is not directly loaded on the hardware.

---

### `dgsIoc/` — Final IOC application

This is the top-level application that ties everything together and produces the actual binary loaded on the MVME5500. "IOC" stands for Input/Output Controller — the software instance running on the hardware board.

`dgsIoc/tcDetApp/src/Makefile` declares the final product and lists every library it needs:

```makefile
gretDet_LIBS += devDGSDriverSupport  # from dgsDrivers/
gretDet_LIBS += asyn                 # from synApps/
gretDet_LIBS += seq pv               # from sncseq/
gretDet_LIBS += $(EPICS_BASE_IOC_LIBS)  # from epics/
```

The EPICS build system bundles all of those libraries into a single binary (`gretDet.munch`) via the munch process described below.

Also contains:
- `iocBoot/iocArray/vme*.cmd` — startup scripts run on each MVME5500 at boot
- `db/` — EPICS database template files (`.template`, `.db`) defining PVs
- `dbd/` — merged database definition

---

### `munch.tcl` — C++ startup table generator

VxWorks 5.5 does not automatically call C++ static constructors (code that runs when a program loads) or destructors (code that runs when it unloads). The "munch" step works around this: it scans the compiled binary for constructor/destructor symbols and generates a small C file that registers them, which is then compiled and linked back into the final binary. Without this step, any C++ objects with static initialization would silently fail to initialize.

## Host Requirements

**OS**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (linux-x86_64)

**Packages**:
```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc-12 g++-12 flex libfl-dev make perl tcl
```

| Package | Why it is needed |
|---|---|
| `gcc-12` / `g++-12` | Host C/C++ compiler. GCC 13 is too strict for the older C++98 code in EPICS 3.14. |
| `flex` + `libfl-dev` | Lexer generator used to build `snc` (the state machine compiler). |
| `perl` | Used by EPICS build system scripts. |
| `tcl` | Used by `munch.tcl`. |

**Cross-compiler**: pre-installed at `x86-linux/` (from https://coda.jlab.org/drupal/content/ppc-cross-compilers)

---

## Build

```bash
# Build everything in order (epics → asyn → sncseq → dgsDrivers → dgsIoc)
make

# Build individual components
make epics
make asyn
make sncseq
make dgsDrivers
make dgsIoc

# Clean everything
make clean

# Clean individual components
make clean-epics
make clean-asyn
make clean-sncseq
make clean-dgsDrivers
make clean-dgsIoc
```

The Makefile automatically sets `EPICS_HOST_ARCH=linux-x86_64` and prepends `x86-linux/bin` to `PATH` so the cross-compiler tools are found first.

All paths inside the build system are self-relative — no absolute paths need to be updated when the project directory is moved or renamed.

---

## Build Pipeline

The diagram below shows how each component depends on the others. Arrows represent "provides input to". Build order must follow this dependency chain — EPICS base must be built before anything else.

## Build Outputs

The build is a two-stage pipeline. The first stage builds libraries; the second stage links them all into the single file that runs on the hardware.

### Stage 1 — Intermediate libraries (inputs to dgsIoc)

These are compiled code libraries (`.a` files — think of them as packages of pre-compiled functions). They are not loaded on the hardware directly; they are ingredients for the final binary.

| File | What it contains |
|---|---|
| `epics/base-3.14.12.1/lib/vxWorks-ppc604_long/*.a` | 14 EPICS base libraries — channel access, database engine, utilities |
| `synApps/asyn4-17/lib/vxWorks-ppc604_long/libasyn.a` | Driver abstraction layer |
| `sncseq/sncseq-2.0.12/lib/vxWorks-ppc604_long/libseq.a` | State machine runtime |
| `dgsDrivers/lib/vxWorks-ppc604_long/libdevDGSDriverSupport.a` | DGS hardware driver code |
| `dgsDrivers/dbd/dgsDriver.dbd` | EPICS process variable definitions |

### Stage 2 — Final loadable (produced by dgsIoc)

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `dgsIoc/bin/vxWorks-ppc604_long/gretDet.munch` | The complete IOC binary — all libraries bundled in, ready to load on VxWorks |
| `gretDet.munch` | Copy in the project root — convenient for deployment to the MVME5500 |

---

## VxWorks Munch Process

VxWorks 5.5 is an older embedded OS that does not automatically run C++ initialization code when a binary is loaded. The "munch" process works around this limitation. It is run automatically by the EPICS build system as part of producing any VxWorks binary.

**Step by step:**

1. **Compile** — each `.c`, `.cpp`, and `.st` source file is compiled to a `.o` object file (a compiled but not yet combined fragment).

2. **Link** — all `.o` object files and all `.a` libraries are combined by `ldppc` into a single binary file called `gretDet`. This binary is in **ELF format** (Executable and Linkable Format — the standard binary format on Linux and VxWorks). At this point the binary is complete but is missing C++ initialization.

3. **Extract constructor symbols** — `nmppc gretDet` reads the binary's symbol table (the list of all function and variable names inside) and pipes it into `munch.tcl`. The script looks for special symbols named `_GLOBAL__I_*` (C++ static constructors — functions that must run at load time) and `_GLOBAL__D_*` (destructors — run at unload time).

4. **Generate registration code** — `munch.tcl` writes a small C file (`gretDet_ctdt.c`) containing arrays of those constructor/destructor function pointers.

5. **Re-link** — `gretDet_ctdt.c` is compiled and linked back into the binary, producing `gretDet.munch`. When VxWorks loads this file, the startup code walks those arrays and calls every constructor, properly initializing all C++ objects.

```
Source files (.c, .cpp, .st)
        │ compile with ccppc
        ▼
  Object files (.o)  +  Libraries (.a)
        │ link with ldppc
        ▼
  gretDet  (ELF binary, missing C++ init)
        │ nmppc | munch.tcl
        ▼
  gretDet_ctdt.c  (C++ constructor/destructor table)
        │ compile + re-link
        ▼
  gretDet.munch  (complete ELF binary, ready for VxWorks)
```

---

## Loading on VxWorks (MVME5500)

Only one file needs to be transferred to the board and loaded. `gretDet.munch` contains everything — EPICS base, asyn, the state machine runtime, and the DGS driver — all statically bundled in. On the VxWorks shell:

```
ld < gretDet.munch
```

`ld` is the VxWorks dynamic loader command. The `<` redirects the file into it. VxWorks loads the binary into memory, resolves addresses, calls all the C++ constructors registered by the munch step, and the IOC starts up.

This matches the existing startup scripts in `dgsIoc/iocBoot/iocArray/vme*.cmd`.

## DMA Buffer Architecture — VME Readout Internals
_Source: `DGS_SVN/dgs/Documentation/Formal/Software/howTheSenderWorks.docx` (T. Madden, APS-XSD Detector Group)_

### FIFO Poll → DMA → Buffer Queue pipeline

1. **`inLoop.st`** (per digitizer board, runs in VxWorks EPICS state machine): polls the digitizer FIFO status register at `*(board_base + 1)`. Returns one of: `Empty`, `HalfFull`, `Some`, `Wait`, `AlmostEmpty`.
2. On data available: calls `serviceOneBuffer()` in `readDigFIFO.c`, which:
   - Acquires **`DMASem`** (epicsEventFull semaphore) — DMA library in VxWorks 5.x is **not thread-safe**, so all 4 digitizers per crate share a single mutex.
   - Takes a free buffer from **`qFree`** via `msgQReceive()` (VxWorks message queue, FIFO order).
   - Initiates **DMA transfer** from digitizer VME FIFO directly into IOC memory (no CPU copy).
   - Posts the filled buffer onto **`qWritten`** via `msgQSend()` for the sender to pick up.
3. **`SendReceiveSupport.c`** drains `qWritten` → sends data to Linux cluster over TCP (port 9001) → returns buffers to `qFree` via `putFreeBuf()`.

**Three VxWorks msgQ queues** (all `MSG_Q_FIFO`, capacity `RAW_Q_SIZE=200`, message size = `sizeof(rawEvt*)` = 4 bytes — they pass *pointers*, not data):
| Queue | Role |
|-------|------|
| `qFree` | Available (unallocated) buffer slots |
| `qWritten` | Filled buffers waiting for TCP sender |
| `qSender` | (Legacy/reserved — exists but lightly used in current code) |

✅ verified 2026-04-11 — `QueueManagement.c:L83-97` (`msgQCreate` calls) + `readDigFIFO.c:L124-212` (receive from qFree, send to qWritten)

### Buffer Pool
- **200 buffers** total, shared across all 4 digitizers in a crate ✅ verified 2026-04-08 — `DGS_DEFS.h:L48` (`RAW_Q_SIZE = 200`, changed from 400 on 2023-04-12 JTA)
- Each buffer: **1 MB** (`RAW_BUF_SIZE`) ✅ verified 2026-04-08 — `DGS_DEFS.h:L34` (changed from 512 KB on 2023-04-12 JTA)
- Queue size: **`RAW_Q_SIZE = 200`** (defined in `DGS_DEFS.h`; previously 400 before April 2023)
- Each buffer has a **reference counter** — zero = free, non-zero = in use

> **Note:** The salvaged notes (`20180924_notes.txt`) document the older values (RAW_Q_SIZE=400, RAW_BUF_SIZE=512KB). These were doubled/halved in April 2023 — same total memory (~200MB), different trade-off.

### Trigger Throttle (software fallback)
- If buffers in Return Queue fall below **1/3** of `RAW_Q_SIZE` (i.e., <67 free with current Q=200), `TrigCon.st` asserts `TrigInhL` and `TrigInhD` via EPICS CA.
- This is a **software path** — latency can be 10+ ms at high rates. Hardware FIFO throttle (half-full flag → RTRG throttle line) is the primary fast mechanism.

### Garbage Collection (optional, compile-time)
- If enabled: when Return Queue falls below **100 buffers** (50%) or **25 buffers** (12.5%), a background process scans all 200 buffers, checks reference counters, and returns free ones to `gDigRawRetQ`.

---

## Quick Notes

- EPICS 3.14 (not 7.0) — VxWorks IOC uses the older EPICS. Do not mix with EPICS 7.0 paths.
- Cross-compiler is NOT in git — must download from JLab before building
- `migration.md` documents how this was ported from Solaris/con6 to Ubuntu
- Each VME crate loads the same `gretDet.munch` but uses a different boot script with crate-specific parameters
